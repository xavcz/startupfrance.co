# Startup France Community Portal
These are the premises of the [Startup France Slack Group](http://startupfrance.co) community portal which is available at http://startupfrance.co

It will be based on a Meteor stack \o/ ...instead of a Typeform embedded in a Tumblr (ie. current state).

## What's up in there?
1. ~~Slackin~~ [Slackit](https://github.com/acemtp/slackit): the keystone is Slack, so in order to new fellows to come in with ease, there will be an autoinviter form right in the middle.
2. [Telescope](http://www.telescopeapp.com): an awesome hackernews-like content curation tools to help the community being engaged
3. [Product Hunt France](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1568895080049162/1678125165792819): a watcher of posts being submitted on the french public group of the community
4. [TheFamily TV](https://github.com/xavizalote/meteor-startupfood-slack): get the TheFamily TV delivered instantly directly in your Slack team.

Some great stuff incoming, stay tuned and feel free to contribute ! :)
